# Global YouTube Analysis 

> This project is based on the analysis of global YouTube data. The goal was to identify trends in content types, channel earnings, viewership, and geographic reach. I cleaned, explored, and visualized the dataset using Python, SQL, and Power BI to extract insights and create a compelling dashboard.
